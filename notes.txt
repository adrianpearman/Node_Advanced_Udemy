JavaScript code that we write => NodeJS => V8 & libuv

NodeJS 50% C++ 50% JS
V8 70% C++ 30% JS 
libuv 100% C++

V8 is used to interpret and execute javascript code, while libuv is used for accessing the filesystem and some aspects of concurrency

process - an instance of running a program
thread - essentially a todo list that needs to be processed by the computers cpu
os scheduler - decides which thread should be processed
more cpu cores will allows for more processes to be completed

node utilizes an event loop sequuence to dictate how fast the application runs each thread.

Node Event Loop => Single threaded
Some of Node Framework/Standard Library => Not single threaded

libuv by default creates 4 additional threads inside of the thread pool. the thread pool will allow for computational code to run at the same time.
